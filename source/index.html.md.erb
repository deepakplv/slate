Plivo exposes a list of REST APIs to perform various actions on phone numbers.
The base URL for all API requests is

`https://api.plivo.com/v1/`

You can view JSON response samples in the dark area to the right.

## Authentication

All requests to Plivo API are authenticated with Basic Auth using your AUTH ID and AUTH TOKEN Your Plivo AUTH ID and AUTH TOKEN can be found when you login to your [dashboard](https://manage.plivo.com/dashboard/).
<%= image_tag 'auth_id_auth_token.png' %>

## Content Type
Plivo only accepts input of the type application/json. All POST requests arguments must be passed as json with the Content-Type set as application/json.

All GET and DELETE request arguments must be passed in the query string.
